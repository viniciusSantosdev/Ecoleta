# About this Project

Ecoleta is a little project for study in Next Level Week.

So far, I've studied some of the CSS concepts, like: box model.
Besides that, i started to study about page responsiveness and how stylize using CSS.

I studied some of the JS too. I maked the states and cities using JS.
